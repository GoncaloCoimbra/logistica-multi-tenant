# GPS Tracking History Improvements - v2.0

## 📋 Summary of Changes

The following improvements were implemented in the transport tracking history module:

### ✅ New Features Implemented

#### 1. **Interactive Map Route Visualization**
- `TrackingMap.tsx` component that displays all routes on a Leaflet map
- Color coding for different states: ✅ Complete (green), 🔵 In progress (blue), ⏳ Pending (orange)
- Markers for origin (S) and destination (F)
- Polylines to visualize the route trail
- Auto zoom to fit visible routes
- Popup with information when clicking markers

#### 2. **Visual Route Simulator**
- `RouteSimulator.tsx` component to simulate route movement
- Playback controls (play/pause/restart)
- Adjustable simulation speed (0.5x, 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x)
- Real-time progress bar
- Display of current location (lat/lng/speed)
- Elapsed time vs total time counter
- Jump to end of route

#### 3. **Button to Delete GPS Tracking**
- "Delete All" button with confirmation
- Confirmation modal to prevent accidental deletions
- Two levels of cleaning:
  - **Tracking Only**: Eliminates historical GPS data
  - **Complete Transport**: Eliminates individual routes with permission verification
- Visual feedback during operation

#### 4. **Backend REST Endpoints**
- `GET /transports/tracking-routes/all` - Gets all tracking routes
- `DELETE /transports/tracking-routes/clear-all` - Deletes all tracking (Admin/Super Admin)
- `DELETE /transports/tracking-routes/:id` - Deletes tracking for a specific route

### 🎨 New Libraries Installed

```json
{
  "leaflet": "^1.9.x",
  "react-leaflet": "4.2.1",
  "@types/leaflet": "^1.9.x"
}
```

### 📁 Created/Modified Files

**Frontend:**
- ✅ `src/components/TrackingMap.tsx` - New map component
- ✅ `src/components/RouteSimulator.tsx` - New simulator component
- ✅ `src/styles/leaflet.css` - Custom styles for Leaflet
- ✅ `src/pages/LiveTrackingAndRouteOptimization.tsx` - Updated with new features
- ✅ `src/App.tsx` - Add Leaflet CSS import

**Backend:**
- ✅ `src/modules/transports/controllers/transports.controller.ts` - 3 new endpoints
- ✅ `src/modules/transports/transports.service.ts` - 3 new methods

### 🔐 Permissions and Security

- **GET /transports/tracking-routes/all**: Requires ADMIN, OPERATOR or SUPER_ADMIN
- **DELETE /transports/tracking-routes/clear-all**: Requires only ADMIN or SUPER_ADMIN
- **DELETE /transports/tracking-routes/:id**: Requires ADMIN, OPERATOR or SUPER_ADMIN
- Automatic company_id validation for multi-tenancy

### 🚀 How to Use

#### On History Page (tab "Histórico"):

1. **View Routes on Map:**
   - The interactive map shows all routes with different colors
   - Click on a route to select it and see details

2. **Simulate a Route:**
   - Select a route on the map
   - The simulator will appear automatically
   - Use control buttons to play the route
   - Adjust speed as needed

3. **Delete Tracking:**
   - Click the "Delete All" button to delete all history
   - Confirm in the confirmation modal
   - Or click the 🗑️ icon next to an individual route to delete only that one

### 📊 Demo Data

The system generates example routes with:
- Realistic GPS points (latitude/longitude)
- Timestamps for each point
- Simulated speed
- States: pending, in progress, complete

### 🛠️ API Examples

```bash
# Get tracking routes
GET /api/transports/tracking-routes/all
Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}

# Delete all tracking
DELETE /api/transports/tracking-routes/clear-all
Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}

# Delete specific tracking
DELETE /api/transports/tracking-routes/{transportId}
Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}
```

### 📝 Development Notes

1. **Maps:** The map uses OpenStreetMap (OSM) as tile provider
2. **Coordinates:** Coordinates are predefined in example data. To use real data, integrate with a GPS service
3. **Performance:** The map supports hundreds of routes without significant degradation
4. **Responsiveness:** Components are fully responsive and adapt to different screen sizes

### 🔄 Suggested Next Improvements

1. Integration with real GPS provider (Google Maps, Mapbox, etc.)
2. GPS data storage in database
3. Route analysis (time, distance, fuel)
4. Real-time alerts when vehicles deviate from route
5. Tracking report export in PDF
6. Integration with notification system for arrivals/deviations

### ✨ Custom Components

#### TrackingMap Props
```typescript
interface TrackingMapProps {
  routes: TrackingRoute[];
  selectedRouteId?: string;
  onRouteSelect?: (routeId: string) => void;
  animateSimulation?: boolean;
  simulationSpeed?: number;
}
```

#### RouteSimulator Props
```typescript
interface RouteSimulatorProps {
  route: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    origin: string;
    destination: string;
    locations: Location[];
    startTime: string;
    endTime: string;
    status: 'completed' | 'in_progress' | 'pending';
  };
  onSimulationUpdate?: (progress: number, location: Location) => void;
  onSimulationComplete?: () => void;
}
```
