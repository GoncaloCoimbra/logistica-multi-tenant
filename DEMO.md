## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Pre-seed data**
   ```bash
   cd backend-nest
   npm run seed
   # Populates realistic demo data
   ```

2. **Dark mode** - Already enabled (see top menu)

3. **Slow network simulation** - DevTools > Network > Throttle to "Slow 3G" to see loading states

4. **Create multiple accounts** - Test multi-tenant isolation by creating 2 users in different companies

5. **Mobile view** - Press F12, toggle device toolbar to see responsive design

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Data not loading?
```bash
# Check database connection
# Verify .env DATABASE_URL is correct
# Run migrations:
cd backend-nest
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Port already in use?
```bash
# Change port in backend .env
PORT=3001

# Or kill process:
# Windows: taskkill /pid YOUR_PID /f
# Mac/Linux: kill -9 YOUR_PID
```

### Can't login?
```bash
# Create new user via signup
# Or query database directly:
cd backend-nest
npx prisma studio
# Create user in Users table
```
