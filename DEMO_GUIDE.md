# 🎮 Como Usar a Demo no Portfolio

## Acesso Rápido (Para Revisores de Portfolio)

A demo foi projetada para funcionar **sem fricção** - como os demos de jogos. Qualquer pessoa pode testar o app em segundos:

### 1️⃣ **Start the Application** (Clone & Run)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GoncaloCoimbra/logistica-multi-tenant.git
cd logistica-multi-tenant

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start backend (terminal 1)
npm run --workspace=backend-nest start:dev

# Start frontend (terminal 2)
npm run --workspace=frontend start

# Seed demo data (one-time, terminal 3)
npm run --workspace=backend-nest seed:demo
```

**Result:** Backend runs on `http://localhost:3000`, Frontend on `http://localhost:3001`

### 2️⃣ **One-Click Demo Access** (On Login Screen)

## 🌍 Using the Demo for Portfolio Review

### **Best Practices for Reviewers:**

1. **Start the app** (frontend + backend)
2. **Open `http://localhost:3001`**
3. **Click "Try Demo"** for instant access
4. **Explore these key features:**
   - ✅ Dashboard with real-time metrics
   - ✅ Product management (create, edit, view history)
   - ✅ Supplier list with details
   - ✅ Multi-tenant isolation (only demo company data visible)
   - ✅ User management (admin view)
   - ✅ Portuguese UI localization
   - ✅ Responsive design (mobile-friendly)

### **Key Differentiators to Notice:**

- **Data Completeness:** 12 products with full movement history
- **Real Workflows:** Product → IN_ANALYSIS → APPROVED → DISPATCHED
- **Multi-Tenant Ready:** Only sees "Demo Company" data
- **Professional UI:** Dark theme, real-time charts, responsive
- **Portuguese Support:** All labels translated
- **Security:** Role-based access (OPERATOR role in demo)

---

## 🔍 What the Demo Doesn't Show

- **Create/Edit Products** (OPERATOR role is read-only for demo safety)
- **Delete Operations** (protected in demo mode)
- **User Registration** (demo account pre-created)

*This is intentional* - like game free trials, you see all features but core creation/deletion is limited.

---

## 🚀 Upgrading from Demo

To use full features (create/edit/delete products):

1. **Create your own account:**
   - Go to `/register` on login page
   - Create company and user
   - Full admin access to your company data

2. **Or login as test admin:**
   - Email: `admin@logistica.com`
   - Password: `admin123`
   - Full permissions for your test company
