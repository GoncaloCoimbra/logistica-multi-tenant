Complete inventory and logistics management system for multiple companies (multi-tenant), with state control, movement history, and metrics dashboard.

---

 📋 Main Features

  Company and User Management
- Registration of independent companies
- Multi-tenant with total data isolation

- Validation of state transitions

 Product States
1. **Received** → Product arrived at warehouse
2. **Under analysis** → Being verified
3. **Rejected** → Non-conforming
4. **Approved** → Validated for storage
5. **In storage** → Stored in warehouse
6. **In preparation** → Being packaged
7. **In shipping** → In transport
8. **Delivered** → Arrived at destination
9. **In return** → Returned to supplier
10. **Eliminated** → Discarded
11. **Cancelled** → Shipment cancelled

 Dashboard and Metrics

  How to Run the Project

 Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed
- Node.js 18+ (optional, for development)

 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd LOGISTICA-MULTI-TENANT
```

 2. Configure environment variables

**Backend (.env in backend):**
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/logistica"
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-here"
PORT=5000
```

**Frontend (.env in frontend):**
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

 3. Run with Docker
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up --build

# Wait until you see:
# ✓ Backend running on port 5000
# ✓ Frontend running on port 5173
# ✓ PostgreSQL running on port 5432

 4. Access the application

- **Frontend:** http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API:** http://localhost:5000

  Security

- Mandatory JWT authentication
- Automatic filtering by `company_id` in all queries
- Permission validation by profile (Admin/Operator)
- Input validation in all routes
- Total data isolation between companies

---

 Business Rules

 State Transitions
- **Only Administrators** can approve products
- **Operators** can receive, prepare, and ship
- Certain transitions require mandatory data (ex: rejection reason)
- All transitions generate history record

 Multi-Tenancy
- Each company has unique `company_id`
- All queries are automatically filtered
- Users only see their company's data



 Tests
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm test

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm test
```


  Useful Scripts

 Backend
```bash
npm run dev          # Development
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run migrate      # Run migrations
npm run seed         # Populate database
```

 Frontend
```bash
npm run dev          # Development
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview the build



 Troubleshooting

 Error: "Port 5000 already in use"
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Linux/Mac
lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9
```

 Error: "Cannot connect to database"
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
docker ps

# Restart services
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build
```

 Clean everything and restart
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up --build
```
